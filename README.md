## Curtis Herbert
#### Consumed by Code, Technical Consultant

I specialize in crafting both web-based and iOS applications. My company Consumed by Code has lead dozens of individuals, startups, and small businesses through the process of planing, building, and successfully launching their product ideas. I work directly with my clients as a partner; looking to understand their business and customers, seeing where technology can add value. This approach ensures the product is successful, be it a consumer-facing app that delights or a web-based system that optimizes their business.

I’d encourage you to visit my company’s website, <http://consumedbycode.com>, to read client stories from past projects and learn more about how I can help you.

Hi, my name is Glen and I’m a developer in the Philly area open for contract gigs and full-time positions (on-location or remote.) I have spent over 550 hours coding in iOS and have developed 35 small apps.

## Austin Seraphin
#### Accessibility Consultant

I became blind at birth and have programmed all my life. Currently I specialize in iOS accessibility consulting. I can work with developers to make their apps more usable to the blind. It often doesn’t take that much work. I believe in universal accessibility so charge affordable rates. For a sample of my work check out motion-accessibility, a RubyMotion gem to make programming accessibility easier, as well as a text console especially suited to blind iOS developers. <http://austinseraphin.com> • <austitn@austinseraphin.com>
